# FizzBuzz_TDD

## A task to determine a way of designing code to make it more testable with unit testing. 
The task was to design a method that evaluated numbers in a range and determined whether they were divisible by 3, 5 and 15 respectively. The method had to be designed in a way that allowed the user to have confidence in it.

A method to divide numbers was created and tested before being implemented as part of the larger method. This meant that testing for the more complex method could be simplified.
